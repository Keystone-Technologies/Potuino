# Potuino
rfiduino.ino and cc3000.ino each work with their respective shield plugged in
as expected.  The goal is to merge the code into potuino.ino and have both
working together: to be able to both read RFID data and send that data via
HTTP using wireless.

Additional expectations of potuino will be documented here.
